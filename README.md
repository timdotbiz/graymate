## What Graymate Does

Blog frontmatter manager for [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter). Creates, validates, and enforces frontmatter schemas so you can just focus on creating great content.

Works great with Next.js, Gatsby, and more.

## How It Works

To get started run:

```bash
graymate init
```

This will create a `graymate.json` file in your project's root directory.
